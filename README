$NAME_BASIS
name_file.basis    -> Name of the file with the basis
$NAME_DM2
name_file.dm2      -> Name of the file with the DM2 (in primitives)
$THRESHOLD
1e-10              -> Threshold for storing the DM2 terms   
$TAU
1e-10              -> Tau from Cioslowski article (for the screening threshold)   
$RADIAL            (Use for SCAN the intracule: Incompatible with $LEGENDRE but compatible with $ANGULAR)
0.0e0              -> Initial Point for 'u'
0.05               -> step size
10                 -> Last Point
$LEGENDRE          (Use a Legendre Quadrature for |r_12| coordinate: Incompatible with $RADIAL but compatible with $ANGULAR)
10                 -> Order for the Legendre Quadrature (some integer)
1e99               -> Superior limit of the integral (e.g. for integral _0 ^12  write 12) Note: Use 1e99 for Infinity 
$ANGULAR           (Spherical average via Sphere-Lebedev Rule)
6                  -> Angular grid for the spherical average (set 0 for none spherical average). 
$ANGULAR2          (Spherical average via Legendre theta & phi)
40                 -> Theta
50                 -> Phi
$PARALLEL          (OpenMP parallelization of the intracule's evaluation [Only available for $LEGENDRE not for $RADIAL])
4                  -> Number of THREADS to use. 
$REDUCE            -> Only include this keyword if the symmetry reduction of the DM2 terms must be peformed (Not mandatory! Recall i<=>k and j<=>l symmetry in the integrals).
$INTRACULE         -> To compute the intracule (is incompatible with $MOMENTS but compatible with $EXTRACULE)
$EXTRACULE         -> To compute the intracule (is incompatible with $MOMENTS but compatible with $INTRACULE)
$MOMENTS           -> To compute second moments (x1x2, x1y2, etc.) Is incompatible with $INTRACULE and $EXTRACULE
